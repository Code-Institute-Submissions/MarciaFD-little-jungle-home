        <h3>Aloe Vera</h3>
        <p>
            Aloe vera has been growing by people for numerous years and it is one of the most extensively used medicinal 
            plants on the world. One important thing in the care of aloe vera houseplants is to understand that this plant is a succulent. 
            Like cacti, succulents do best in dry conditions. 
            Also is important to have the proper light, aloe vera plants need bright light, so they do best in south or west-facing windows.
            Aloe vera plants cannot tolerate standing water that s why one the most common reason an aloe plant dies is that the owners water too often, 
            or do not allow the water to drain. Growing aloe vera indoor plant is not only easy but can also provide your family with a plant
            that can help treat minor burns and rashes.

            <p>
                Proper care for anthurium is not hard. Once you have the plant in the right soil and the right location, watering is simple.
                Only water your anthurium when the soil is dry to the touch, but don’t overwater because the plant is susceptible to root rot,
                so too much water can cause the roots to die. If you allow the plant to become too dry in a pot, it will slow down its growth
                and the rootball will be difficult to re-wet. If the rootball becomes too dry in the pot, soak the pot the anthurium plant is
                in for an hour to rehydrate it. The plant only needs to be fertilized with a one-quarter strength fertilizer once every three
                to four months. To get the best blooms, use a fertilizer that has a higher phosphorus number (the middle number).

        <h3>Chinese Money Plant </h3>
        <p>
            Pilea peperomioides, often referred to as the Chinese money plant, coin plant, pancake plant, or UFO plant is a popular
            houseplant thanks to its attractive coin-shaped foliage and ease of care. This plant has a unique appearance with straight stems
            and coin-like leaves. It looks perfect in a short pot and is also very solid. 
            Typically, it requires watering once per week and will grow well in bright spaces. Remember, however, that this is one of these indoor
            plants that don't need direct daylight because they like lots of indirect light but do poorly in direct sun. They should be placed near
            a sunny window, but just far away from of the sun’s rays. They also like sandy, well-draining soil and should be allowed to dry out 
            between waterings. They need very little feeding, but will do well with occasional additions of standard houseplant compost. 
            It's a great idea for your home stylistic decor. You will adore it!

        <h3>Kalanchoe</h3>
        <p>
            Kalanchoe is a popular succulent that boasts long-lasting flowers and fascinating foliage. It is native to Madagascar. 
            There are over 125 species in this family, but the one you’re going to probably to come across in flower shops or 
            supermarkets is Kalanchoe blossfeldiana. Growing Kalanchoe indoors is quite simple when placed in the right conditions 
            like a well-draining soil to avoid root rot. Similar to other succulents, do not over-watering, just an occasional watering. 
            Also, low humidity and four hours of direct daylight — as well as 14 hours of darkness for 6 to 11 weeks — are musts, as well.

        <h3>Peace Lily</h3>
        <p>
            Peacy lily (Spathiphyllum), also known as closet plants, are a common choice for offices and homes. When it comes to indoor plants, 
            peace lily plants are the absolute simplest to care for, however, proper growing conditions are still important. Growing Peace Lily 
            as Houseplants Peace lilies make excellent houseplants for the home or office. These lovely plants not only brighten up a living space, 
            but are also excellent at cleaning the air of the room they are in.  Perhaps of the most well-known mistakes when taking care of a peacy
            lily is overwatering. Peacy lilies are definitely more easy-going toward underwatering than overwatering, which is one of the most
            well-known explanations behind a harmony lily to kick the bucket. It is a result of this, you ought to never water harmony lily plants 
            on a timetable. Rather, you ought to really look at them once every week to check whether they should be watered. Essentially touch the 
            top point of the soil to check whether it is dry. Assuming it is, water your plant. Harmony lilies don't require regular fertilizing.
            Just fertilizing with a decent compost one to two times each year will be sufficient to keep the plant blissful.

        <h3>Snake Plant (Sansevieria)</h3>
        Snake plant care is very straightforward. These plants can be neglected for weeks at a time; yet, with their strappy leaves and architectural shape, they still look fresh. Additionally, they can survive low light levels, drought and have few insect problems. NASA research has even shown that snake plants are able to help keep the air inside your home clean, removing toxins such as formaldehyde and benzene. In short, they are the perfect houseplants.
        One of the most common issues experienced/encountered with snake plants (and other succulents) is overwatering.
        These plants don't endure wet soil well; they incline to develop root rot. To stay away from this, don't water too often times. 
        Allow the soil   to dry out between waterings. Water from the lower part of the pot, if possible. This urges the roots to develop descending and profound, assisting with settling the thick, tall leaves.
